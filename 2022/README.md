# My Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

My solutions are written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Will possibly redo some of the solutions in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

| Year | Solutions             | Inputs                |
| ---- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| 2022 | [Solutions](src/2022) | [Inputs](inputs/2022) |

## How to run solutions/tests:

To run with rust run this command:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin {year}-day{number of day}
```

To run rust tests

```bash
cargo test
```

To run with typescript run this command:

```bash
deno run --allow-all src/{year}/typescript/Day{number of day}.ts
```
